inGenius Live Page (2013)
========================
This is a countdown timer made for __inGenius 2013 hackathon__ conducted by the __PESIT-BSC ACM Student Chapter__.

Notes:
------
* `2_video.html` sets the end time (T + 24 hrs) as a cookie. Modify it as per your wish.
* Background images are stored in `./assets/img/backgrounds`
* Specify the images to be displayed (and in what order/duration/fade time) in `./assets/js/scripts.js` file

Important
---------
Once the counter has been started do _not_ run the _2_video.html_ file again; doing so will reset it!  
In case of any interruptions just open `count2.html` again.
